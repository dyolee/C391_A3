SQL COMMAND TO CREATE INDEX:

	CREATE INDEX subjPred ON rdf (subject, predicate);




JUSTIFYING USE OF INDEXES:

Technically, in the scope of this assignment, indexes are not necessary. Without
an index, however, query (especially very lengthy ones) will take a very long
time to execute. Creating an index made our queries run a lot faster. The reason
why we created an index on subject and predicate is that most of our queries
include those two columns.

Creating an index on the subject and predicate is good because there are a lot
of repetition for those two columns. So the index values are few but efficient
as it breaks down the table in an optimal way.

Creating an index only on the subject is not good because often there are very
few distinct subjects in comparison to predicates. So there will only be a few
index entries and speedup will not be a lot.

Creating an index on subject, predicate, and objects are the worst case
scenario. having an index on the object as well basically makes the number of
index entries almost the same as the number of values in the table, and resulted
in little speedup for us.
